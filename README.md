# iCage
*iCage* is a Web Full-stack application for organizing amateur football tournaments. A project that was developed for 4+ years,
based on the users' feedback. It contains:

- Scheduler with Prediction on available players for a given match.
- League table
- Scouter (inspired the players status display in Pro Evolution Soccer 5)
- Cup and Top Scorer standings
